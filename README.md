# enco_cypher

## Enco_Cypher is a Python-based encoder-decoder application, ensuring secure data transformation. With advanced encryption algorithms, it safeguards information while providing seamless decoding. Ideal for privacy-conscious users seeking a reliable and efficient solution for secure data communication and storage. A Python program with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter for encoding and decoding text with various algorithms.

## Features

User-friendly GUI for text input and output.
Support for multiple encoding and decoding algorithms.
Error handling for invalid inputs and algorithm failures.
Save encoded or decoded text to a file.
Supported Algorithms

### Base64:

Encoding:
Uses the standard Base64 encoding.
Decoding: Decodes Base64-encoded text.
Caesar Cipher:

Encoding: Shifts each letter by a random value (for demonstration purposes).
Decoding: Shifts each letter back to the original position.
Custom Algorithm:

Placeholder for a custom encoding and decoding algorithm.
How to Use
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/enco_cypher.git
cd encoder-decoder-gui
Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Program:

python main.py

Use the GUI:

Enter text in the input field.
Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Encode" or "Decode" button.
View the result in the output field.

Save to File:

Click the "Save to File" button to save the current output to a file.
# Additional Notes
Feel free to customize the program by adding more algorithms or improving the user interface.
The random shift for the Caesar Cipher is for demonstration purposes; you may choose a fixed shift if needed.
Implement your custom encoding and decoding algorithm in the "Custom" section.
For any issues or improvements, please open an issue.

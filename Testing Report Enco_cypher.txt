Testing Report
Test Case 1: Basic Encoding
Result: Passed

Observations:

The input "Hello, World!" was successfully encoded using the Base64 algorithm.
The output "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==" matches the expected result.
Test Case 6: Empty Input Field
Result: Passed

Observations:

The program correctly displayed an error message when attempting to encode an empty input.
Test Case 8: Encode and then Decode
Result: Passed

Observations:

"Integration Test" was successfully encoded using Base64.
After decoding the encoded string, the original input was correctly displayed in the output.
README for Testing
This README file is designed for testing purposes and provides instructions on how to run the testing suite for the Encoder and Decoder program.

How to Run Tests
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/encoder-decoder-gui.git
cd encoder-decoder-gui
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Testing Suite:

bash
Copy code
python test_suite.py
Testing Suite
The testing suite comprises various test cases covering different aspects of the Encoder and Decoder program. These include unit tests for encoding and decoding algorithms, GUI testing, and integration testing. A successful run of the testing suite should display "Passed" for each test case.

Recommendations:
Modify Test Cases: Feel free to modify existing test cases or add new ones based on your specific testing requirements.
Automated Testing: Consider integrating automated testing tools for continuous testing during development.
